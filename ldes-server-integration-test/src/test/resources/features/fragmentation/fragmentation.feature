Feature: LDES Server Fragmentation

  @pagination
  Scenario Outline: Server Can Paginate an LDES
    Given I create the eventstream <eventStreamDescriptionFile>
    When I ingest 617 members of template <template> to the collection <collection>
    Then the LDES <collection> contains <ingestedMemberCount> members
    And I wait until all members are fragmented
    When I fetch the root "paged" fragment of <collection>
    And I fetch the next fragment through the first "Relation"
    Then this fragment only has 1 "Relation" relation
    And this fragment is immutable
    When I fetch the next fragment through the first "Relation"
    Then this fragment only has 1 "Relation" relation
    And this fragment is immutable
    When I fetch the next fragment through the first "Relation"
    And this fragment contains <restCount> members
    And this fragment is mutable
    And this fragment has no relations
