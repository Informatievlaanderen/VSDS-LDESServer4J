# Using relative URI's

When using the server with relative URI's, all resources hosted on the server will have a URI relative to the page on which they are found.

> **Note**: When using relative urls, requests can not be performed with application/n-quads or application/n-triples as accept-type.
> This is because these types don't support resolving the relative URI's
