# Read Linked Data Event Streams with the LDES Client

As a Linked Data Event Stream is mainly built to be read by machines, the LDES Client can take on a LDES endpoint.
The LDES Client will replicate the Event Stream and then synchronise with it to listen for
new updates.

To use this component, please refer to the [LDIO LDES Client Documentation](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Linked-Data-Interactions/ldio/ldio-inputs/ldio-ldes-client)
