# Retention Policies

To reduce storage fill up, it is possible to set a retention policy per view.
A retention policy has to be added together with its view.

## Retention polling interval
By default, every day, the server checks if there are members that can be deleted that are not conform to the retention policy anymore.
If a higher retention accuracy is desired, or a lower one if resources are limited for example, then a respectively lower or higher retention polling interval can be set via a cron expression.

To configure this interval, please refer to the [Configuration Page.](../../how-to-run#ldes-server-config)
