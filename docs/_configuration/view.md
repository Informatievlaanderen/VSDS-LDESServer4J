# Configuring a new View for an Event Stream

After having created an Event Stream, a view needs to be defined to be able to retrieve the data.

This can be done through the Admin API at the `/admin/api/v1/eventstreams/{event stream}/views` endpoint.

A view config needs to have the following structure:

* A tree:viewDescription object with its subject referring to the event stream object
  * a `tree:FragmentationStrategy` object that contains an ordered rdf list of fragmentations.
  * a `ldes:retentionPolicy` object that contains a set of retention policies.
  * a `tree:pageSize` object that marks how many members should be partitioned per fragment.

For more info, visit the Swagger API endpoint configured in [the run guide.](../how-to-run)

### Fragmentations

To provide a more structured overview of the data, a fragmentation list can be defined.

For a more detailed explanation on fragmentation, together with all the available options, 
visit the [Fragmentations Subsection](./fragmentations).

### Retention Policies

To reduce the amount historical of data kept in the LDES Server, one can configure 
a set of retention policies. 

For a more detailed explanation on retention policies, together with all the available options,
visit the [Retention Policies Subsection](./retention-policies).
