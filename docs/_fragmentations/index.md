# Linked Data Interactions Project

## Introduction

The Linked Data Interactions project is an effort to make interactions with Linked Data more fluently by providing easy building blocks. 

This project was created in function of the [VSDS project]

## Supported Frameworks

Currently, we support 2 frameworks to use these building blocks in:
* [Linked Data Interactions Orchestrator](ldio): A lightweight application maintained by the LDI team.
* [Apache Nifi][Apache NiFi]: A powerful system to easily process and distribute data

### Component support over frameworks

As the LDI team is rather small and focused on supporting the [VSDS project], we sometimes have to postpone full 
integration of our building blocks in all supported frameworks.

However, since the LDI project is open source, feel free to contribute and/or create issues at our [GitHub project][Linked Data Interactions]
