# How to run

We advise running the LDES Server as a Docker Image which we provide
via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldes/ldes-server/):

* Latest Official
  version: [![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ldes/ldes-server/latest)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldes/ldes-server/tags)
* Latest Alpha
  version: [![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ldes/ldes-server)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldes/ldes-server/tags)

To decide which version to take, visit
the [Release Management Advice](https://informatievlaanderen.github.io/VSDS-Tech-Docs/release/Release_Management#which-version-should-i-use)
and visit the [LDES Server Github Release Page](https://github.com/Informatievlaanderen/VSDS-LDESServer4J/releases/) for
an overview of all the releases.

## LDES Server Config

The LDES Server provides a variety of tweaking options to configure it to your ideal use case:

| Feature             | Property                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Default Value |

| Swagger Config      | springdoc.swagger-ui.path               | As the LDES Server provides an Swagger API to easily configure your Streams, a url needs to be configured that points to the swagger documentation.

|                     | spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation | Enables the server to automatically create indices in mongodb. If this property is not enabled, you have to manage the indices manually.
