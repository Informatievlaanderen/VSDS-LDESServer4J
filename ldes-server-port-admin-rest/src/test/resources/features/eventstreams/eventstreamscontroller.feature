Feature: event streams can be configured at runtime
  Scenario: get all event streams
    Given a db containing multiple eventstreams
    When the client calls "/admin/api/v1/eventstreams"
    Then the client receives HTTP status 200
    And the client receives a valid list of event streams

  Scenario: get an existing event stream
    Given a db containing one event stream
    When the client calls "/admin/api/v1/eventstreams/name1"
    Then the client receives HTTP status 200
    And the client receives a single event stream

  Scenario: get a non-existing event stream
    Given an empty db
    When the client calls "/admin/api/v1/eventstreams/name1"
    Then the client receives HTTP status 404
    And I verify the event stream retrieval interaction

  Scenario: put a valid event stream
    Given a db which does not contain specified event stream
    When the client puts a valid model
    Then the client receives HTTP status 200
    And I verify the event stream in the response body


  Scenario Outline: put a invalid event stream
    When the client puts invalid model from file <fileName>
    Then the client receives HTTP status 400
    And I verify the absent of interactions
    Examples:
      | fileName              |
      | ldes-without-type.ttl |
      | malformed-ldes.ttl    |

    Scenario: delete an existing event stream
      Given a db containing one event stream
      When the client deletes the event stream
      Then the client receives HTTP status 200
      And I verify the db interactions

  Scenario: delete an non-existing event stream
    Given an empty db
    When the client deletes the event stream
    Then the client receives HTTP status 404
    And I verify the event stream retrieval interaction
